SYNTAX: me

SUMMARY
The "me" command allows you to view each and every field in your
Nameserver entry including sensitive fields that cannot be viewed by
other users.  In order to use "me", you must first login to the
Nameserver (see help on "login").  Then enter "me" at the "ph>" prompt.
The contents of your entire entry will be displayed.

"Me" is particularly helpful in conjunction with commands that allow
you to change fields in your own entry such as "make" and "edit".  It
can be used to verify that the changes you made were what you intended.

The "me" command does not show fields that are empty (do not exist) in
your entry.  The Nameserver is capable of holding much more information
for a person than is normally provided by the Office of Payroll (for
faculty/staff) and the Office of Admissions and Records (for students).
To add additional information to your entry, such as your birthday,
special projects on which your are working, your office hours, etc.,
you must add additional fields using the "edit" or "make" command.  To
see a list of fields that can be added to your entry and a description
of the kind of information each field is intended to hold, use the
"fields" command.
