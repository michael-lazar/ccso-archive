SYNTAX: add name-of-field=value-of-field...

SUMMARY
This command is used to add new entries to the Nameserver database.
Most users are not allowed to use the "add" command. You must be logged
into ph and have special privileges to use "add".

Note that the "add" command adds entire ph ENTRIES; to add one or more
FIELDS to an entry, use the "edit", "change", or "make" command.

"Add" creates a new entry and gives its fields the values specified in
the command.

EXAMPLE
ph> add name="doe john" id="123456789" alias="j-doe"
200:Ok.
ph>

WORD TO THE WISE
Make sure you give your new entry at least one indexed field, or it
will be impossible to query the Nameserver for information contained
in the entry.

SEE ALSO: edit, change, make, delete, login, fields
