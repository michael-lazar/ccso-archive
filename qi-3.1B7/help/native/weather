PH WEATHER INFORMATION

Ph can display weather information for many locations throughout the
state and country.  It also offers some special options for local weather
information. The weather information is downloaded over serial lines
from a commercial service.  The raw data is fed to a CCSO computer and
is the source for several CCSO weather-related services including that
provided by ph.  Ph weather information is updated in real-time as it
arrives on the data feed.

EXAMPLES:
Weather conditions for a particular location are requested with the
syntax:

  ph type=weather airport_code(or city_name) conditions

where "airport_code" or "city_name" is the name of the location in which
you are interested.  The airport codes and corresponding city names for
which information is available are given below:

  ALN  alton           DSM  desmoines     MWA  marion
  ARR  aurora          FNT  flint         MVN  mtvernon
  BLV  belleville      GBG  galesburg     NBU  glenview
  BMI  bloomington     IND  indianapolis  ORD  chicago ohare
  BOS  boston          JFK  newyork       PIA  peoria
  CGX  meigs           LAX  losangeles    PDX  portland
  CMI  champaign       MDH  carbondale    RFD  rockford
  CMX  houghton        MDW  midway        SFO  sanfrancisco
  COU  columbia        MLI  moline        SPI  springfield
  CPS  eaststlouis     MMO  marseilles    STL  stlouis
  DEC  decatur         MSN  madison       SYR  syracuse
  DPA  dupage          MSY  new orleans   UIN  quincy

Note that city names consisting of more than one word are sometimes
written as a single entity with no spaces (e.g., sanfrancisco), and
other times are not (e.g., new orleans).  Due to this inconsistency, it
may be easiest to use the three letter airport code instead.  The
following example shows a request for Champaign weather conditions along
with the query results:

   ux1 11> ph type=weather cmi conditions

The first two lines of the "text" field in the example above consist of
the raw weather data.  In the remaining lines, the raw data has been
parsed and given labels so that it is easier to understand.

In addition to current weather condition information, ph can also display
radar summaries, special weather announcements, and 36 hour as well as
extended forecast information.  These services are largely limited to
the state of Illinois.  The sample queries in the left-hand column will
yield the results listed in the right-hand column:

  Query                                 Result
  -----                                 ------

                                        radar summaries

  ph type=weather forecast              36 hour and extended
                                        forecast for Illinois
