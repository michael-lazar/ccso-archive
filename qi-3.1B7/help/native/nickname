SUMMARY
The "nickname" field is provided so that nicknames can be used in
Nameserver queries.  While the "name" field of the Nameserver database
contains every user's full name (as known by the University), often
individuals are more commonly known by names other than their full names.
"William" might be known to most people as "Bill", or "Steven" as
"Steve".  A user may enter any nicknames by which he or she is known
into the "nickname" field of his or her entry.  Other users can then
use the full name or nickname to find that user.

The Nameserver treats the "nickname" field just like the "name" field;
nothing special is required to use a nickname in lookups.  In other
words, if a Nameserver query is issued without any field specifiers, ph
will look at both the "name" and "nickname" fields for entries that
match the query expression.

EXAMPLE
Suppose "William Willard" is known to everyone as "Willy," and he would
like people to be able to easily find his entry in the Nameserver.
William can use the ph "edit" or "make" command to put "willy" in his
"nickname" field.  Once he has done so, others can find him in the
Nameserver database using either of the following query expressions:

   ph> ph william willard

   ph> ph willy willard

SEE ALSO: edit, make, query
