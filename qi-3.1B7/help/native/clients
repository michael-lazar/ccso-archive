Ph client programs permit users of desktop computers and
workstations connected to the campus network (UIUCnet) to use the
CCSO Nameserver without logging on to a CCSO mainframe.  They
provide convenient access to server data without requiring
knowledge of unfamiliar operating systems or text editors. At
least one ph client program is available for each of the desktop
platforms commonly found on the UIUC campus.  A table of the ph
clients available at the time of this writing (July 1992) is given
below.  The table lists the platform/operating system for which
the client is intended, the name of the client program, its
anonymous ftp location, the name of the directory in which it
resides, and the filename(s) of the program and documentation.
When using the table, it is important to keep in mind that the
names, version numbers, and locations of programs and files on
anonymous ftp servers may change frequently.  Up-to-date
information about ph clients can often be found in the Netnews
(USENET) newsgroup "info.ph" or by querying the "archie" anonymous
ftp database.
