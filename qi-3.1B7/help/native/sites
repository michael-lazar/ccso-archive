THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN
The UIUC ph server is installed on a VAXserver 3500 running Ultrix 3.0.
Its fully-qualified domain name is "garcon.cso.uiuc.edu" (also aliased
as "ns.uiuc.edu").  The Nameserver database contains information on some
70,000 students, faculty, and staff. It also contains the phone numbers,
personnel, and addresses of major UI departments; information on
restaurants in the C-U area; up-to-date weather information; US telephone
area codes; and the current UIUC class timetable.

OTHER SITES
Many other universities have adopted the ph program to maintain their
own student/staff directory and e-mail routing information.  Several ph
clients are capable of querying these remote ph Nameservers for name,
phone number, address, and e-mail address information.  To see a current
list of ph servers and associated sites, do a Nameserver lookup on
"ns-servers".  For example:

   ph ns-servers

The list of ph sites and servers at the time of this writing was:

Notre Dame University                       ns.nd.edu
Brown University                            ns.brown.edu

To query another server using the Unix ph client (and clients similar
to it), get to the operating system prompt and use the syntax:

   ph -s server.name query

For example, to get ph information for a "John Smith" at Princeton
University, one would type the command:

   ph -s princeton.edu john smith

The query will be directed to the ph server specified after the "-s"
option (Princeton University, in the above example), instead of the
local ph server, and all matching entries will be displayed.

Note: Not all ph clients are able to query remote servers, and the method
of doing so varies from client to client.
