You did not specify an Indexed field in the query part of your command.
Each and every Nameserver query (or "change", "add", or "delete" command)
must use at least one Indexed field (such as "name", "alias", "email",
etc.) as part of its entry selection criteria.  To see a list of
Nameserver fields and their attributes, use the "fields" command.
