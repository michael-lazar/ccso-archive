To change information about yourself in your Nameserver entry, you must
login to the Nameserver (see help on "login").  When you login, ph

Nameserver from the account listed in your "email" field, the Nameserver
may not request a password during the login process.

OBTAINING YOUR PASSWORD
To obtain your Nameserver password, bring a valid University ID to the
CCSO Accounting and Distribution Office, 1420 DCL, 1304 W.  Springfield,
Urbana.  While you are there, you can also ask the staff at this office
to make changes to your ph entry for you.

PLEASE do NOT request someone else's password.  CCSO does not give
passwords to third parties.  If you have a spouse, friend, enemy,
acquaintance, boss, employee, classmate, or total stranger whose entry
you think you should change, you must prevail upon that person to obtain
his or her password at the above-named location and give it to you.
