You have asked to view a field that you are not allowed to view.  You
may view all fields in your own entry (except the "password" field,
which is not viewable) when you are logged in to the Nameserver.  When
viewing entries other than your own, you may only view those fields with
the "Public" attribute.  To see a list of fields and their attributes,
use the "fields" command.
