SUMMARY
The "paper" field controls how your electronic mail address will appear
in the printed Student/Staff Directory.  You have three options:

1. If your "paper" field is empty, your email address will be listed in
the printed directory as "your-alias@uiuc.edu"; for example,
"p-pomes@uiuc.edu".  E-mail so addressed will be delivered to whatever
account you have listed in the "email" field of your ph entry.  We
strongly suggest you exercise this option and leave your "paper" field
empty.  This is the default; you need do nothing to select it.

2. If your "paper" field is set to "no", your email address will not be
printed in the Directory at all.

3. If your "paper" field is set to "specific", the address contained in
the "email" field of your ph entry will be listed in the Student/Staff
Directory.  WARNING:  If you exercise this option and then get a new
e-mail address, your previous e-mail address will be listed incorrectly
for as long as a year, since the Directory is printed only once per
year.

EXAMPLES:

To change your "paper" field, you must first login to ph (see help
on "login").  Then:

If you want to see this kind of      Enter this ph command:
address in the Directory:

   p-pomes@uiuc.edu                     make paper=""

   paul@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu                make paper="specific"

   <none>                               make paper="no"

Note: The "make" command is not available through all ph clients.
You can also use the "edit" command to change the contents of your
"paper" field to one of the three options described above.
