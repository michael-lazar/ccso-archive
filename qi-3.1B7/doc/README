The files in this directory are documentation for the Unix Ph client.  These
docs were written especially for the University of Illinois and, thus,
there are references to things that only apply to UIUC.  (Also, we have
a VM/CMS client and the docs address special issues related to that
platform as well.)

Feel free to download these files and use them as is or modify them to
suit the needs of your own institution.  Please do acknowledge, however, that
the original source was from UIUC and written by Lynn Ward and Carolyn Gendney.


Here are the files in this directory and their description:

ph.ps  =  postscript version

ph.pm4.2.sit.hqx  =  stuffed/binhexed Pagemaker 4.2 file for the Mac.

ph.txt = a quick and dirty ASCII version with hard returns at the end of
         every line

ph.txt.wrap = a quick and dirty ASCII version with hard returns at the ends of
              paragraphs and tabular data only.

Enjoy
