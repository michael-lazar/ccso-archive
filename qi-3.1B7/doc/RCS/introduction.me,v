.uh "What is the CCSO Nameserver?"
.lp
The CCSO Nameserver could be considered a database containing
information about people and things at the University of Illinois.
It is designed to be extremely flexible in terms of the information it keeps
and also to provide fast access to that information.
Currently, most of the information in the Nameserver database
comes from the University
.i "Student/Staff Directory"
(the printed phone book).
The database also holds several additional categories of
information such as the complete university course timetable
for the fall, spring, and summer semesters;
a guide to local restaurants;
area codes for major cities and regions in the U.S.;
up-to-the-hour weather condition and forecast information for many
Illinois cities and larger metropolitan areas throughout the country;
and special entries created on request such as
organizations within departments and student clubs and groups.
.lp
The CCSO Nameserver could also be regarded as a pair of programs:
one that manages the actual data (this program is called
.i qi ,
for
.i q uery
.i i nterpreter),
and another program (or rather a group of programs \-
one for each computing platform on the campus network)
that handles end-user requests.
The programs that handle user requests are usually called
.i ph
(or
.i ph
clients), which stands for phone book.
Because
.i ph
is the name of the software familiar to most end-users,
many people refer to the Nameserver itself as
.i ph
or use the terms Nameserver and
.i ph
interchangeably.
.uh "Where is it?"
.lp
The database for the Nameserver is installed on a
VAXServer 3500 that runs the UNIX operating system (Ultrix 3.0);
the name of this CCSO computer is garcon.cso.uiuc.edu with the alias
ns.uiuc.edu.
The program that manages the database (\c
.i qi )
also runs on this machine.
.i Qi
allows programs running on other computers to access the database
by serving as an intermediary between them and the actual database.
.lp
The Nameserver functions on a
.q server-client
basis.
This means that the database and query interpreter reside on a single
computer (the VAXserver described above), which functions as the
.q "server" .
Mainframes and desktop computers can transparently access server data
over UIUCnet, the campus network, using special software designed to
communicate with the server.
Machines running such software (and the end-user software itself)
are typically referred to as ph
.q clients .
.i Ph
client programs have been developed for almost all of the mainframe
and desktop computing platforms and operating systems found on the
UIUC campus including UNIX, VM/CMS, VMS, PC (DOS), Macintosh, Next,
and X Windows.
Some of these clients were developed locally,
while others have been developed by programmers at other institutions.
.lp
A full-featured
.i ph
client is available on all CCSO-administered UNIX computers.
A slightly less robust client can be found on the CCSO IBM mainframe VMD.
.i Ph
client software is also installed on hundreds of desktop computers
and workstations on the campus network.
Client software for desktop computers such as IBM PCs and Macs provides
convenient access to server data without requiring a mainframe account
or special knowledge of an unfamiliar operating system or text editor.
For a list of ph clients and information on where to get them,
see ph's on-line help for
.q clients .
.uh "What Services Does the Nameserver Offer?"
.lp
The Nameserver can be used to find the phone numbers and addresses of
University faculty, students, and staff members,
just like the printed version of the
.i "Student/Staff Directory" ;
but the Nameserver is not a mere electronic copy of the campus phone book.
For one thing,
it contains the electronic mail addresses for thousands of faculty,
students, and staff.
It also includes additional information about some individuals
such as office hours, birthdays, vacation plans, facsimile numbers, etc.
Information of the latter sort is usually entered manually by the owner
of the entry and is, thus, available for some people in the database and
not others.
.lp
The Nameserver also contains entire categories of information not found
in the
.i "Student/Staff Directory" ;
e.g., weather conditions, local restaurants, national area codes,
the university course timetable, etc.
For information on how to extract such information from the Nameserver,
see
.i ph 's
on-line help for
.q people ,
.q campus_units ,
.q weather ,
.q areacodes ,
.q restaurants ,
and
.q timetable .
.lp
A key thing to know about the Nameserver is that,
if you use a computer that has a full-featured
.i ph
client installed on it,
you can change the information the Nameserver keeps about you.
For example, if your office address or phone number changes
in the middle of the year,
you can put your correct address and phone number in the Nameserver immediately
so that people can use
.i ph
to find up-to-date information about you.
.lp
Another very important function of the Nameserver is electronic mail forwarding.
If you tell the Nameserver where you read your electronic mail by recording
this information in your
.q email
field,
then anyone wishing to send mail to you can send the mail to
.i alias@@uiuc.edu ,
where
.i alias
is your Nameserver alias (a unique name by which the Nameserver knows you,
generally formed by your first initial, a hyphen, and your full last name).
If someone doesn't know your Nameserver alias,
s/he can send mail to
.i your\-name@@uiuc.edu ,
and the Nameserver will try to find you.
In either case,
the Nameserver will send your mail to the address listed in the
.q email
field of your nameserver entry.
For example,
you can send mail to Steven Dorner (author of the UNIX
.i ph
program)
using the address: s-dorner@@uiuc.edu (\c
.q s\-dorner
is Steve's Nameserver alias),
or steven\-dorner@@uiuc.edu (Steve's real-life name).
Either way,
the mail will be forwarded by the Nameserver to
.q dorner@@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu ,
which is where Steve currently reads his mail.
For more information on e-mail forwarding, see the
.i ph
on-line help for
.q e-mail .
.uh "Nameserver Restrictions and Limitations"
.lp
There are some things the Nameserver is not meant to do.
One thing that should be mentioned right away is that the Nameserver
can't be used to generate mailing lists for junk mail.
The server is designed so that queries that generate more than 25
responses are refused.
So, you don't have to worry about getting junk mail because you
appear in the Nameserver's database.
.lp
Also, the Namserver cannot be used to notify the University
about changes of address, phone number, and/or other personal or
official information about yourself.
Although you can change this kind of information in your Nameserver entry,
such changes are not automatically sent to your department,
the Office of Admissions and Records,  Payroll, or anywhere else.
You must notify these offices individually by filling out the
appropriate paperwork.
.uh "Using Ph to Find Information"
.lp
.i Ph
can be used to look up information about people or things in
the Nameserver database or to change information in your own entry.
The specific procedures involved will depend on the
.i ph
client you use.
To use
.i ph
to find out information about a person, type
.q ph
and the name of the person you want to know about
(note: some
.i ph
clients do not require the user to type the command
.q ph
before the name);
.i ph
will respond with information about that person.
For example:
.(b
\f(CR%\fP \f(CBph steven dorner\fP
.ft CR
----------------------------------------
      name: dorner steven c
     phone: 244-1765
   address: 181 dcl
          : CAMPUS MC 256
department: computing services office
     title: res programmer
     hours: 7-5, four days per week.
  email to: s\-dorner@@uiuc.edu (dorner@@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu)
----------------------------------------
.ft
.)b
.lp
If there are lots of people who have the name you asked for,
.i ph
will let you view the list a screenful at a time;
just hit the spacebar to move to the next screen.
(Here again, the method of advancing from one screen to the next
will depend on the client you use.
Most
.i ph
clients take advantage of the native characteristics of the platform
on which they are installed.
Thus, the Macintosh client requires you to use the scroll bar in
order to move to the next screen, the VM/CMS client waits for you
to press the "clear" key, etc.)
.lp
If you do not know the exact spelling of a name,
you can use special symbols in the name to take the place of one or more
unknown characters.
These symbols are called
.q metacharacters .
I won't say anything more about metacharacters here;
see the on-line help for
.q manpage
and
.q query
for more information.
.lp
Sometimes, you will ask
.i ph
for a name, and it will refuse to give you information
because too many people have that name.
For example:
.(b
\f(CR%\fP \f(CBph steven\fP
.ft CR
502:Too many entries to print.
.ft
.)b
.lp
.i Ph
does this so that no one can use it to create mailing lists
for junk mail or other nefarious purposes.
If you really want to find the person,
you will have to know something else about them,
like part of their last name
(or first name, if you know their last name),
their phone number,\**
.(f
\** See the
.i ph
manual page for information on how to search for people with a
certain phone number or address.
.)f
or some other piece of information that has been recorded in their
Nameserver entry.
Suppose, for example you know this fellow named Steven who works in DCL,
but you don't know his last name.
You could say:
.(b
\f(CR%\fP \f(CBph steven address=dcl\fP
.)b
and all of the
.q steven s
who have
.q dcl
in their
.i address
field would be displayed.
.uh "Using Ph to Change Information"
.lp
.i Ph
can also be used to change information.
Not all
.i ph
clients, however, permit the user to access his or her own entry and edit it.
The following discussion focuses on the UNIX
.i ph
client and clients similar to it such as the VMS, VM/CMS, and DOS client.
(The Macintosh
.i ph
client also allows a user to login and change his or her entry,
but the procedure is entirely different from that described here.
Full documentation is available for the Mac client.)
.lp
If you want to change the information the Nameserver keeps about you,
type
.q ph
at the operating system prompt.
.i Ph
won't look up a name,
but will instead give you a special 
.q ph>
prompt.
There are many possible commands you can type once at
the 
.q ph>
prompt;
they are described in full in the
.i ph
manual page and also in the
.i ph
on-line help for
.q commands .
You will only need to know four commands to change your information:
.b login ,
.b me ,
.b edit ,
and
.b quit .
Before actually using
.i ph
to change your entry, you will have to make some preparations.
.lp
The first thing you need to do is find out your Nameserver
.i alias .
This is a unique name assigned to you by the Nameserver.
A person's alias is usually formed by combining his or her first
initial, a hyphen, and complete last name.
For example,
.q "Steven C. Dorner"
has an alias of
.q s-dorner .
Some people share the same first initial and last name;
these people typically have a number added to the ends of their
aliases so that their aliases remain unique.
For example,
.q "John Doe"
might have an alias of
.q j-doe1 ,
and
.q "Jane Doe"
might have an alias of
.q j-doe2 .
The easiest way to find your alias is to look up your name with
.i ph .
.lp
Once your know your alias,
you need to find out your Nameserver password.
To do this, come to the CCSO Resource Center in Room 1420 DCL and present
a valid University ID at the Accounting Desk.
We cannot give out passwords via email or phone to prevent disclosure to
unauthorized persons.
In cases where
a)
.i ph
is being used by the same user-id on the same machine that's listed in the
email field, and
b)
.i ph
has been installed
.q "setuid root" ,
and c) the
.i ph
version is 5.2 or greater, then no password is needed to login.
.lp
Now, it's time to use
.i ph
to change your information.
Type
.q ph
and the
.q return
key.
You will get a 
.q ph>
prompt.
Now, type
.q "\f(CBlogin alias\fP"
(but use your real alias, not the word
.q alias !)
and a return.
.i Ph
will ask for your password; type your password and a return.
You should get a greeting from the Nameserver, and another prompt.
For example:
.(b
\f(CR%\fP \f(CBph\fP
.ft CR
$Date: 1992/08/06 22:06:56 $$Revision: 5.7 $
100:Ph passwords may be obtained at CCSO Accounting, 1420 DCL.
100:Be sure to bring your University Id Card. You may not need
100:a password if you are using the login in your email field.
200:Database ready.
.ft
.)b
.(b
\f(CRph>\fP \f(CBlogin s\-dorner\fP
.ft CR
Enter nameserver password:
200:s\-dorner:Hi how are you?
ph>
.ft
.)b
.lp
You are now ready to change your information.
Your Nameserver entry is organized into
.q fields ,
each one containing a different piece of information.
There is a field for your name, your address, your phone numbers, etc.\**
.(f
\** The
.i ph
command
.b fields
will give a complete list of Nameserver fields.
.)f
To see all of the fields in your entry, type the command
.b me
at the 
.q ph>
prompt.
It's always a good idea to use the
.b me
command before and after changing an entry to verify the original
and new contents of your entry.
.lp
To change a particular field, type
.q "\f(CBedit field\fP"
and a return,
substituting the name of the field you wish to change for
.q field .
For example, if you want to change your phone number, type
.q "\f(CBedit phone\fP" .
You will be placed in your favorite UNIX editor,\**
.(f
\** Unless you take pains to change it,
that editor will be
.i vi (1);
see Appendix A if you've never used
.i vi
before.
.)f
with the current contents of the field you specified displayed.
If the field was empty,
you will be presented with an empty file into which ypu can insert text.
Make whatever changes you wish, save your changes, and exit the editor.
.i Ph
will then change the information in the field specified for you.
.lp
If you aren't familiar with your machines's text editor,
you may prefer to use the
.b make
command instead.
.b N.B. ,
the
.b make
command does not work properly with the VM/CMS client.
After you login to
.i ph ,
just type,
.ft CB
make name-of-field="value-of-field"
.ft
.(b
\f(CRph>\fP \f(CBmake email="dorner@@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu"\fP
.ft CR
200:1 entry changed.
ph>
.ft
.)b
.lp
When using the
.b make
command, be sure to enclose the
.q value-of-field
information is double quotation marks (").
.lp
Some field information cannot be changed;
the
.q name
field, for example.
If you need to change such a field,
arrangements can be made with the staff at the CCSO Accounting
and Distribution Office in 1420 DCL.
.lp
Once you are finished changing your information,
type
.b quit
and a return.
You will be logged out of
.i ph
and returned to the operating system prompt.
.uh "Suppose I Don't Have Access to a Ph Client?"
.lp
If your computer doesn't have a
.i ph
client installed on it, but you would like to use
.i ph
to look up addresses or change your information,
you can still do so.
Connect to the CCSO's Sequent computer ux1
by using telnet (\c
.q telnet ux1.cso.uiuc.edu" ),
sytek (\c
.q "call 1600" ),
or by dialup (333-4000, ux1).
When you see the
.q login:
prompt,
type
.q phones
and a return.
You will then be prompted for your terminal type.
If you have a vt100 terminal or terminal emulator,
you can just type a return;
if you have some other terminal, type its name.\**
.(f
\** If you have trouble finding the right name to use for your terminal,
call the CCSO Consultants at 333-6133.
.)f
You will eventually get a 
.q ph>
prompt, and can use
.i ph
to lookup and change information.
.uh "Where Can I Find More Information About Ph?"
.lp
.i Ph
has an extensive on-line help system.
UNIX users can access it by entering
.i ph 's
interactive mode, and typing,
.b help .
.(b

.ba 0
.lp
This page describes a few
.i vi
commands to accomplish simple editing tasks.
Full documentation for
.i vi
can be found in
.i "The UNIX User's Manual Supplementary Documents" ,
chapter 15 (really advanced users should read chapter 16 as well).
Two thing to keep in mind:  First, the editor is pronounced
.q "vee eye" ;
if you pronounce it,
.q vie ,
UNIX gurus will laugh at you, though not out loud.
Secondly,
.i vi
is case-sensitive;
be sure to use upper or lower case commands as appropriate.
.uh Modes
.lp
.i Vi
is a modal editor;
what you can do depends on what mode you are in.
The two modes of interest to us are
.i command
mode and
.i insert
mode.
You type most commands in command mode;
all you do in insert mode is type your text.
You get out of insert mode by typing
.i escape ,
usually marked
.q esc
on keyboards;
on some keyboards, you may have
to hold down the control or alt key and press
.q [ .
If you type escape in command mode,
.i vi
will beep at you; so if you get confused,
just type escape until
.i vi
beeps; then you'll be back in command mode.

a55 1
It is designed to be extremely flexible in what information it keeps,
d57 2
a58 1
Currently, most of the information in it comes from the University
d60 10
a69 1
(the phone book).
d71 1

The CCSO Nameserver could also be considered to be a pair of programs;
d77 16
a92 10
and another one that handles user requests
(the program CCSO provides for this is called
.i ph ,
for
.i ph one
book).
To most people, the CCSO Nameserver will be exactly this second program,
.i ph ,
which gives them access to the University
.i Directory .
d95 4
a98 3
The database for the Nameserver resides on a CCSO minicomputer
(a VAXServer 3500) that runs the UNIX operating system;
the name of this computer is garcon.cso.uiuc.edu.
d101 1
a101 1
runs on this machine.
a104 5
It communicates with such programs using the campus network, UIUCnet.\**
.(f
\** UIUCnet is a multi-protocol, multi-media network.
Access to the Nameserver is via TCP/IP only.
.)f
d106 12
d119 8
a126 4
(the program that is usually used to communicate with
.i qi )
is installed on all of CCSO's UNIX computers.
A simple version of
d128 26
a153 12
is available on CCSO's main IBM computer, and
.i ph
is installed on hundreds of non-CCSO computers across the campus.
A full-featured version of
.i ph
is available for VAX computers running VMS, if they have Wollongong TCP/IP
software.
Versions also exist for Macintosh, PC, and VM/CMS.
Later, I'll discuss how you can get
.i ph
installed on your system.
.uh "What is it good for?"
d155 2
a156 3
The Nameserver is good for looking up phone numbers and addresses of
University faculty, students or staff members,
just like the
d158 13
a170 16
but the Nameserver is good for more than just that.
For one thing,
the Nameserver knows the electronic mail address for thousands of faculty,
students and staff;
this information is more up to date that the
.i "Student/Staff Directory" .
It knows other things about some people,
such as office hours or vacation plans.
Ph also has some other things in it not found in the
.i Directory ;
up-to-the-hour weather information (e.g.,
.q "ph type=weather champaign" ),
the current UIUC timetable (e.g.,
.q "ph cs101" ),
and an extensive listing of local restaurants (e.g.,
.q "ph restaurant other=italian" ).
d173 1
a173 1
if you use a computer that has
d175 5
a179 3
installed on it, you can change the information the Nameserver keeps about you.
For example, if you change offices in the middle of the year,
you can put your correct address and phone number in the Nameserver immediately,
d185 4
a188 1
If you tell the Nameserver where you read your electronic mail,
d193 2
a194 2
is your Nameserver alias (a unique name by which the Nameserver knows you;
see below).
d200 3
a202 1
the Nameserver will send your mail to the address you have told it.
d204 4
a207 1
you can send me mail with the addresses: s-dorner@@uiuc.edu (\c
d209 2
a210 2
is my alias),
or steven\-dorner@@uiuc.edu (my name).
d212 8
a219 4
the mail will be sent by the Nameserver to
.q dorner@@pequod.cso.uiuc.edu ,
which is where I'm currently reading my mail.
.uh "What isn't it good for?"
d223 4
a226 2
can't be used to generate mailing lists for junk mail;
you don't have to worry about getting junk mail because you
d229 9
a237 18
Another thing it isn't good for is notifying the University
of changes of address.
Changes you make to your information in the Nameserver are
.b not
automatically sent to your department,
or the Office of Admissions and Records, or Payroll, or anywhere else;
you must notify these places of changes in your address separately.
.uh "How can I have ph installed on my computer?"
.lp
If one of the computers you use runs UNIX or VMS and is connected to UIUCnet,
you can probably have
.i ph
installed on it.
Tell the person who manages your computer that s/he can get the
source code for ph by anonymous ftp to uxc.cso.uiuc.edu,
in the net/ph subdirectory or the compressed tar archive in pub/ph.tar.Z
(don't worry s/he'll know what that means).
.uh "How do I use ph?"
d239 6
a244 12
There are two different ways to use
.i ph .
One way is good for finding information about people,
and the other is good for changing the information the
Nameserver keeps about you.
I will give you a brief idea of how both these ways work;
for more detailed information,
you should read the "manual page" for
.i ph ,
which you can read (if your computer runs UNIX) by typing the command,
.q "man ph" .
.lp
d247 6
a252 1
to find out information, you should type
d254 1
a254 1
and the name of the person you want to know about;
d256 2
a257 1
will respond with information about that person:
d269 1
a269 1
  email to: s\-dorner@@uiuc.edu (dorner@@pequod.cso.uiuc.edu)
d274 1
a274 1
If there are a lot of people who have the name you asked for,
d278 21
a298 6
.lp
You don't have to know the exact spelling of a name to find information;
you can put special symbols in the name for which you are searching
that tell the Nameserver to find names that you only know a few letters of.
I won't say anything more about that here;
look in the manual page if you are interested in the details.
d302 3
a304 2
for a name, and it will refuse to give you information,
because too many people have that name:
