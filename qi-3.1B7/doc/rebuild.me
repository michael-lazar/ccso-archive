\fBIntroduction
.lp
At the beginning of each semester,
it is necessary to rebuild the database used by the CCSO Nameserver.
The purpose of this annual ritual is to add to the database students and staff members who have joined the University since the last database was installed,
and also to remove those who have left.
.lp
The process could in theory be done on a running database through use of the Nameserver add,
delete,
and change commands.
This approach has several drawbacks: due to indexing demands,
it is slow;
ph performance suffers tremendously during the process;
deleted entries are only marked as deleted,
not removed from the database.
In order to avoid these things,
rebuilding of the nameserver database is done by first dumping the contents of the database into ASCII files,
then combining these files with files produced by reading the tapes supplied by AISS.
.lp
This method is not without its drawbacks.
It takes a long time,
it involves many steps,
the nameserver database has to be locked throughout most of the process,
and it takes quite a bit of disk space.
On the positive side,
the steps themselves are usually fairly simple,
and,
since the build is taking place separately from the installed database,
it can be done on any convenient machine with lots of processor and disk space.
.lp

\fBOverview
.lp
The process begins with three databases;
the extant Nameserver database,
the Staff directory tape,
and the Student directory tape:
.lp

The Starting Point
.lp
.sp
The extant database is locked,
and three sets of data are extracted from it;
the extant students,
the extant staff,
and other entries:
.lp
.sp

Steps 7-11
.lp
.sp
Then,
the Staff tape and the Extant Staff are merged,
as are the Student tape and the Extant Students.
During this merge,
students or staff members appearing only in the extant database,
and not on the tapes,
are deleted.

The Staff and Student databases are now merged;
this is to avoid duplicating entries for students who happen to be employees of the University\(emthese students will appear on both the Staff and Student tapes.

Now,
the resulting data is made into a Nameserver database,
and the miscellaneous data taken from the old database is added into the new database by Nameserver add commands:

The new database is ready for use by the Nameserver.

\fBIntroduction to the Detailed Description
.lp
As complicated as the above description is,
it leaves out many steps and details.
The rest of this document will explain in detail everything that is involved in the creation of a new Nameserver database.
A few things that will help you follow the discussion are:
.lp
\(bu	The process involves many temporary files.
These files follow a distinct naming scheme.
The prefix "\fBf" means the data pertains to staff;
the prefix "\fBs" means the data pertains to students.
The prefix "\fBsf" means the data is student and staff
data combined.
A postfix or infix "\fBtape" means the data came from one of the directory tapes.
A postfix or infix "\fBold" means the data came from the extant database.
A postfix or infix "\fBnew" means the data will be put in the new database.
.lp
\(bu	At many stages of the process,
temporary files may be omitted in favor of pipelines.
This will allow the build to take place in less disk space;
you stand to lose more processing time if something goes wrong,
however.
The frequent use of temporary files allows automatic "checkpointing" of the build process;
if a step fails,
you need only go back as far as the last temporary file to restart.
Let your confidence be your guide...
.lp
\(bu	Most data files are tab-separated lists of fields.
Each field begins with its Nameserver field number followed by a colon.
When files are not in this format,
a note will be made.
During the build process,
it is convenient to have the nameserver prod.cnf file handy for ready reference.

\fBThe 24\-Way Path to Nirvana
.lp

AISS produces 1600 bpi,
unlabelled tapes in ebcdic,
with the data elements in fixed-width fields,
one record per person,
and multiple records per block.
The UNIX utility dd is used to read these tapes onto disk,
doing unblocking and character set conversion.
\fIStudent.tape and \fIstaff.tape should be the names of devices on which the student and staff tapes are mounted.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 1.	dd ibs=12100 cbs=121 conv=ASCII,lcase <\fIstudent.tape >s.tape.raw
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 2.	dd ibs=3500 cbs=350 conv=ASCII,lcase <\fIstaff.tape >f.tape.raw
.lp
.sp
Now,
the tapes are converted from fixed-width lines into tab-separated lines,
and the proper field numbers are prepended to each field.
For students only,
the AISS data element that encodes class and college is expanded into the Nameserver field "curriculum".
The programs s.pb and f.pb perform these marvels.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 3.	s.pb <s.tape.raw >s.tape.id
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 4.	f.pb <f.tape.raw >f.tape.id
.lp
.sp
Next,
the University id's in the data files are converted by ssnid into random Nameserver id's.
This is done with the help of the dbm database IdDB,
which remembers the mappings from University to Nameserver id's.
University id's which have been encountered before will be mapped
into whatever they were mapped into last time;
those not appearing in the database will be assigned at random,
and the choice recorded in IdDB.
The resulting files are sorted on their first fields,
the Nameserver id's.
IdDB should be read in from tape,
the programs run,
and then IdDB should be written back out to tape and removed from disk.
This will assure privacy of University id's.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 5.	ssnid <s.tape.id | sort >s.tape
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 6.	ssnid <f.tape.id | sort >f.tape
.lp
.sp
At this point,
the running Nameserver database must be made read-only by placing a line beginning with "read" in the .sta file (/nameserv/db/prod.sta on our system).
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 7.	echo read for database update >/nameserv/db/prod.sta
.lp
.sp
Once the database is protected from modification,
its contents should be dumped with mdump.
This dumping is done into four different files;
one for staff members,
one for students,
one for campus units,
and one for other entries.
Each dump may contain a different set of fields;
for example,
the "students" dump contains only fields that cannot be found on the student tape,
whereas the "other" dump dumps all fields.
In all cases,
mdump outputs the "id" field first for each entry;
mdump will manufacture a blank "id" field if none is present.
The "other" dump is constructed to select those entries not selected by the other dumps.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 8.	mdump students | sort >s.old
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 9.	mdump staff | sort >f.old
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 10.	mdump other | sort >other.old
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 11.	mdump units >units.old
.lp
.sp
It is now time to reconcile the old data with the new data;
this is done with tmerge.
The idea is twofold;
to drop from the database persons who do not appear on the new tapes,
and to bring along from the old database any fields that are not found on the tapes themselves (e.g.,
email addresses).
.lp
Tmerge takes four arguments;
the name of the file with data from the tape,
the name of the file with data from the extant database,
the name of the file for the merged data,
and (optionally)
the name of a file into which to put entries from the old database that are not going into the new database.
This last argument we do not use;
such entries slip quietly into oblivion.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 12.	tmerge s.tape s.old s.new
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 13.	tmerge f.tape f.old f.new
.lp
.sp
Now,
the stastu program is used to merge the staff and student files.
For staff members who are also students,
some fields will appear in each file (e.g.,
address).
In such cases,
the field from the staff file is given preference.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 14.	stastu f.new s.new >sf.new
.lp
.sp
It is necessary to compute Nameserver aliases for the new database.
To do this,
we extract the current alias (if there is no alias,
we use the magic cookie "{none}")
and the base name for an assigned alias (the last name and the first letter of the first name).
These two items are prepended to each entry from sf.new,
and the whole is sorted into reverse order.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 15.	aliasprepare <sf.new | sort >sf.prealias
.lp
.sp
Awk handily if slowly assigns our aliases.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 16.	awk \-f alias.awk sf.prealias >sf.alias
.lp
.sp
We're getting close now.
Use credb to create a new,
empty database.
The integer argument is the number of slots to use in the hash table;
we use approximately 5 slots per entry.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 17.	credb prod 300007
.lp
.sp
Maked takes our tab-separated ASCII file and makes it into Nameserver .dir and .dov files.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 18.	maked prod <sf.alias
.lp
.sp
It is now time to build the index for the database.
This step takes many hours (six the last time I did it,
on our dual-processor Gould super-mini,
in the dead of night).
It is very disk-intensive.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 19.	makei prod
.lp
.sp
Now we make an index to the index,
to facilitate wildcard searches.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 20.	build \-s prod
.lp
.sp
This step is optional.
If you have been doing the build on a machine with normal byteorder,
and intend to use the database on a machine with reversed byteorder (like a VAX or 80x86),
you must reverse the appropriate bytes in the database.
The border program does this;
it may be run on either the normal or the byte-perversed machine.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 21.	border prod	\fB\s11(Optional)
.lp
.sp

It is now time to move the database into place;
turn off the Nameserver completely,
move the files into place,
and let 'er rip.
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 22.	echo stop installing new database...
>/nameserv/db/prod.sta
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 23.	mv prod.* /nameserv/db
.lp
\fB\s11
\& 24.	rm /nameserv/db/prod.sta
.lp
.sp
Now that the database is up and running,
we use normal Nameserver commands (via qi)
to add in the entries from units.old and anything interesting from other.old.
We then hope that the next semester won't come for a long time...
