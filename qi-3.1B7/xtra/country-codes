     Every now-and-then there are enquiries on the net regarding
E-mail to a distant country. The question is often of the type
"has that country got E-mail access ?". The following table is a
guide of country codes, showing the countries which have access to
Internet or general E-mail services.  The country codes have been
derived from the  International Organization for Standardization 
standard ISO 3166.  A country code is taken as a top level domain
once it is registered at rs.internic.net so *not* all country codes
listed are top level domains. At the bottom of the table, there is
also a section of general top level domains, based on the information
available at rs.internic.net.

NOTES:

1. Description of codes:

FI  stands for FULL INTERNET access. This includes 'telnet', 'ftp',
    and internet E-mail.
B   stands for BITNET access although the address may be in internet
    DNS (Domain Name System) format. 
*   (Asterisk) means that the country is reachable by E-mail. If this is
    not preceded by FI or B, it means that the connection may be a UUCP
    connection. An asterisk is included after FI or B for consistency.
PFI stands for a provisional full internet connection.(+) 
P   stands for provisional connection. (+)
    (+) This is used when one or more of the following is true:
       - address not verified or lack of address
       - UUCP dialup not active
       - net connection possible but not officially announced
       - premature official announcement of connection
F  stands for a country that is connected to Internet only via means
   of the FIDOnet network. It is assumed that the FIDO connection in this
   case is stable and reliable.

2. Networks which are not included:

Networks such as MILNET (U.S. Military's unclassified portion of the
DDN - Data Defense Network) have computers all around the world. It is 
generally possible to assume that wherever there is a U.S. military base, 
there will be a node reachable through gateways.

Private company networks such as for DEC (Digital Equipment Corp.),
or Sun Microsystems, for example, have nodes in many exotic locations.
However the connection may take place via UUCP and cost a lot of money.
Those networks have therefore not been included. In addition, those
are PRIVATE networks.

Many companies ( like U.S. Sprint, for example ) offer commercial 
services to many countries which are not readily available on 
the Internet. The service is VERY COSTLY, usually takes place via
UUCP or X.400 connections. X.400 E-mail is usually charged to
someone and if the telecommunication carrier cannot find someone
to pay for the message transfer, it will reject it. As a result,
those types of network have not been included in the list.
Although a user may RECEIVE E-mail from a user on those networks, one 
may not be able to reply to it.

 
3. Updates:

    The situation changes from day to day. The growth in international
networking is such that the information contained in this document
may be out of date by the time it reaches you.
If you have any update (i.e. knowledge that a new country is connected),
please send a message to <ocl@ic.ac.uk>, including an example address
from the country reached so that it can be verified.
Furthermore, if you are a connection provider or could provide a
low cost connection in a country, and are not listed as a provider in 
that country (see "FURTHER INFORMATION" section), please notify either
Randy Bush <randy@psg.com> or me.
NOTE: This doesn't include providers for North America. 
If you are a North American provider, then please DON'T contact us.


4. .US sites

    While there are several hundreds of BITNET nodes in USA, none have
a name in the format `.US'. That's why the .us domain is only FI and *.

5. .edu, .com, etc.

    The domains in this section are special in that some of them are
used in more than one country. The domains which have full internet 
access are marked accordingly. However, this doesn't mean that *all*
of  those  domains  have  full  internet  access.   For   example,
only a small proportion of .mil sites have full internet access. The
same is true for .com sites, for example.  

6. UK and GB domains

     There are two codes for United Kingdom, namely UK and GB. While 
UK is used for addressing of most domains in DNS format, the field 
GB is used mainly in the X.400 addressing of United Kingdom sites.
However, there is an increasing trend in some United Kingdom sites
being directly connected to Internet under the GB domain. The GB domain
is hence a perfectly suitable Internet top level domain.
When looking for further information, it is worth looking at both
UK and GB for United Kingdom.

7. Further information column

     This column contains information as follows:

- E-mail address of a contact from which further information may be obtained
  and/or
- Details of a gopher system that can be queried for further information
  in this case, look at Section 8: Where to find further information
  or
- If no other information available: nameserver details, if any.
  This is the main nameserver as listed in the rs.internic.net database.
  Those often change as the network grows, and it is hard to keep track of
  all nameservers, but they should usually work. Nameservers can be 
  queried by users using nslookup. 

8. Where to find further information

  A number of sites run on-line information databases, mail-servers,
and gopher information systems where further information can be found.

- rs.internic.net
    Part of this site, the InterNIC database services, contains the
  Internet "white pages". The "whois" section of the "white pages"
  has registration records for top level domains. "whois" can be
  accessed by connecting interactively (telnet rs.internic.net),
  or via gopher (gopher rs.internic.net) or using the "whois"
  command available on some computer systems (whois -h rs.internic.net).
  Registration records for a domain are sometimes useful since they
  provide Administrative and Technical Contacts for this domain
  and those may hence be able to provide further information.

- gopher.ripe.net
    This is a gopher system run by ripe.net, the co-ordinator for
  European Internet nodes. It contains a lot of information regarding
  European IP, etc. It may be accessed either as "gopher gopher.ripe.net"
  or "telnet gopher.ripe.net" and logging-in appropriately. 
  It also has a "whois" database.

- GNET: an Archive and Electronic Journal
  This is co-ordinated by Larry Press <lpress@dhvx20.csudh.edu>
  Archived documents are available by anonymous ftp from the 
  directory global_net at dhvx20.csudh.edu (155.135.1.1).  To 
  conserve bandwidth, the archive contains an abstract of each 
  document, as well as the full document.   
  In addition to the archive, there is a moderated GNET 
  discussion list.  
  To submit a document to the archive or subscribe to the moderated 
  discussion list, use the address gnet_request@dhvx20.csudh.edu.  

- BITNIC Bitnet Network Information Center
    Bitnet LISTSERVs contain files which list all BITNET sites around 
  the world. For a listing of all BITNET sites, in country code order,
  send a message to LISTSERV@Bitnic.educom.edu (or LISTSERV@BITNIC for
  BITNET folks), no subject, and the command: 
  GET NODES INFO3
  in the body of the message.
  A very long file of information on all international BITNET sites
  can be ftp'ed from Bitnic.educom.edu and is called BITEARN.NODES .
  It is more than 2Mb long.

- gopher.psg.com
    This gopher system, maintained by the Network Startup Resource
  Center and PSGnet/RAINet contains perhaps the most comprehensive
  collection of information about country connectivity.
  It may be accessed as "gopher gopher.psg.com". For the gopher client
  impaired, one can telnet to gopher.psg.com and login as gopher. 
  An important feature is an E-mail interface to access the information
  in the gopher system.
  Send E-mail to: server@gopher.psg.com
  any subject, and in the body of the message:

  send country/<country-code>

  Example: if you want further information about Brazil (country code BR)

  send country/BR

  Many thanks to Randy Bush <randy@psg.com> and to John Klensin
  <klensin@infoods.unu.edu> for setting-up this site and this
  collaborative effort.

10. New World-Wide-Web (WWW) document

An experimental (i.e: under construction) WWW version of this document
is available as:

          http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/misc/country-codes.html

This is currently experimental, so its reference may change at short
notice, and some of the links in the document are currently not working.
HTTP references for Top-Level information servers for a particular country
should be sent to <ocl@ic.ac.uk>. 


ISO 3166 Codes + Top level domains.

WARNING:

The link to some countries marked as being connected to Internet via
UUCP or FIDO is often an expensive telephone dialup link. The people
in those countries pay dearly for every byte of information sent to
them. It is therefore not advised to send an electronic mail to a
remote node in such a country asking "how's the weather there".
When it comes to money, people take things very seriously, especially
since funds are scarce. It is a matter of net etiquette to keep this
in mind. Junk mail sent to any node that has to pay a lot for its
telephone connection will clearly be dealt with HARSHLY and evasive
action may well be taken against those not respecting this notice.
