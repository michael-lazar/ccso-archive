 * $Author: p-pomes $
 *
 * A lightweight Kerberos password checker.  It does *not* do mutual
 * authentication for faster execution by default.  If someone has
 * compromised the host enough to change where this program looks for
 * Kerberos information, then the information this check authorizes
 * has already been compromised.
 *
 * Don't use this program to mediate remote access without compiling with
 * -DMUTUAL_AUTH=1  !!!  This also requires running with root privs to read
 * /etc/srvtab.
 *
 * Compile with
 *
 * cc -DKRB4_AUTH -DMUTUAL_AUTH=1 -DKDOMAIN=\"UIUC.EDU\" \
 *	-I/usr/local/include/kerberosIV -o kcheck kcheck.c \
 *	-L/usr/local/lib -lkrb -ldes -lresolv -l44bsd -lsocket -lnsl
 *
 * Input is "<login><WS><password>\n"
 *   <WS> is a *single* white space character (not newline)
 *   <password> can have embedded spaces
 * Output is "<login><WS><code><WS><message>\n"
 *   A <code> of "0" indicates success
 *   <message> is the text explaining <code>
