**	English to Phoneme rules.
**
**	Derived from: 
**
**	     AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION OF ENGLISH TEXT TO PHONETICS
**	            BY MEANS OF LETTER-TO-SOUND RULES
**
**			NRL Report 7948
**
**		      January 21st, 1976
**	    Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C.
**
**
**	Published by the National Technical Information Service as
**	document "AD/A021 929".
**
**
**
**	The Phoneme codes:
**
**		IY	bEEt		IH	bIt
**		EY	gAte		EH	gEt
**		AE	fAt		AA	fAther
**		AO	lAWn		OW	lOne
**		UH	fUll		UW	fOOl
**		ER	mURdER		AX	About
**		AH	bUt		AY	hIde
**		AW	hOW		OY	tOY
**	
**		p	Pack		b	Back
**		t	Time		d	Dime
**		k	Coat		g	Goat
**		f	Fault		v	Vault
**		TH	eTHer		DH	eiTHer
**		s	Sue		z	Zoo
**		SH	leaSH		SH	leiSure
**		HH	How		m	suM
**		n	suN		NG	suNG
**		l	Laugh		w	Wear
**		y	Young		r	Rate
**		CH	CHar		j	Jar
**		WH	WHere
**
**
**	Rules are made up of four parts:
**	
**		The left context.
**		The text to match.
**		The right context.
**		The phonemes to substitute for the matched text.
**
**	Procedure:
**
**		Seperate each block of letters (apostrophes included) 
**		and add a space on each side.  For each unmatched 
**		letter in the word, look through the rules where the 
**		text to match starts with the letter in the word.  If 
**		the text to match is found and the right and left 
**		context patterns also match, output the phonemes for 
**		that rule and skip to the next unmatched letter.
**
**
**	Special Context Symbols:
**
**		#	One or more vowels
**		:	Zero or more consonants
**		^	One consonant.
**		.	One of B, D, V, G, J, L, M, N, R, W or Z (voiced 
**			consonants)
**		%	One of ER, E, ES, ED, ING, ELY (a suffix)
**			(Found in right context only)
**		+	One of E, I or Y (a "front" vowel)
**
