phquery is a fuzzy address backend for sendmail.  It relies on the
presence of a network QI (Query Interpreter) server.  QI is a variant
of the CSnet central name server.  At UIUC it contains the campus
phone book plus several other fields including the preferred Email
address.  phquery converts either a alias (guaranteed unique),
full-name, or amateur radio callsign into a email address.  See the
phquery man page and the man page for ph (QI client) in /net/ph
(via anon-FTP).

phquery should be installed as LIBDIR/phquery where LIBDIR is defined
by the *.m4 files in ../ida/cf.  The default is /usr/local/libdata/mail .
