/* Messages for ErrorReturn().  How simple, yet stupid, do we have to be? */

char	*NoMatchMsg[] = {
 " The message, \"No matches to nameserver query,\" is generated whenever",
 " the ph nameserver fails to locate either a ph alias or name field that",
 " matches the supplied name.  The usual causes are typographical errors or",
 " the use of nicknames.  Recommended action is to use the ph program to",
 " determine the correct ph alias for the individuals addressed.  If ph is",
 " not available, try sending to the most explicit form of the name, e.g.,",
 " if mike-fox fails, try michael-fox or michael-j-fox.",

char	*MultiMsg[] = {
 " The message, \"Multiple matches found for nameserver query,\" is generated",
 " whenever the ph nameserver finds multiple matches for the supplied name.",

 " addressed individual.  Since the supplied information is insufficient",
 " to locate a specific individual, your message is being returned.",
 " To help you locate the correct individual, selected fields from the",
 " possible matches are included below.  The alias field is the only one",
 " guaranteed unique within a given ph community.",
 " ",

};

char	*TooManyMsg[] = {
 " The message, \"Too many matches found to nameserver query,\" is generated",
 " whenever the supplied name or alias matched over twenty five ph nameserver",
 " entries.  In this case no information will be returned about possible",
 " matches.  Recommended action is to supply more specific names, e.g.,",
 " john-b-smith instead of john-smith, or use the per-person unique ph alias.",
 " You may have thought that you had used a ph alias and not a name.  This is",
 " an artifact of the address resolution process.  If the address fails as an",
 " alias, it is retried first as a callsign and then as a name.  While aliases",
 " are guaranteed unique, names can match multiple individuals depending on",
 " how common the name is.",
 " ",
 NULL
};

char	*AbsentMsg[] = {
 " The message, \"E-mail field not present in nameserver entry,\" is generated",
 " whenever the ph nameserver matched the supplied name or alias with an",
 " entry that lacked an email address field.  In this case no delivery can",
 " be made.  Recommended action is to contact the individual by alternate",
 " means via the information included below.  If the individual already has",
 " an email address, s/he should edit their ph entry to include it.  N.B.,",
 " postmaster will not have any information more current than this.",
 " ",
 NULL
};

char	*HardMsg[] = {
 " The message, \"Nameserver hard error; general,\" is generated whenever",
 " the ph nameserver encountered a permanent error in resolving an address.",
 " These errors are sometimes due to actual faults with the nameserver (rare),",
 " or with poorly formatted addresses.  The nameserver requires an address to",
 " have at least one token longer than three characters.  The exact error is",
 " reported below.",
 " ",
