About support: UofI does not offer any.  I realize the documentation is,
well insufficient, however that's the best there is.  If anyone cares to
update any of the existing documents, your name will be enscribed in the
Pantheon of Heros as a reward.

I seldom answer questions since they usually take a fair bit of time.
Sorry, but my job has to take precedence during work hours.  Outside
of that belongs to my family.

My recommendation is to read the docs, skimpy as they are, the source
code, and try experiments.  The info-ph mailing list may also be helpful.
