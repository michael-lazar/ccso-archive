[ The documents here have been converted to vanilla troff/pic/tbl with
  -me macros in the doc directory.  This directory will be removed 
  entirely before the next distribution.  -pbp ]

These documents come in a variety of formats.  The format can be derived
from the filename.  Here are the formats:

.rtf   - Microsoft's Rich Text Format
.ps    - PostScript, produced by the NeXT version of WriteNow.
.macps - PostScript, produced by the Mac version of WriteNow.  You will
         need Apple's "md" PostScript dictionary, which is copyrighted,
	 and ill-behaved to boot.  I suggest obtaining the program "macps"
	 by anonymous ftp to sumex-aim.stanford.edu, somewhere in the
	 "info-mac" directory tree.
.troff - Very raw troff source.
.lpr   - Line-printer suitable stuff.


Not all documents are available in all formats.  The troff and lpr versions
do not contain figures.  The troff and lpr versions of some documents (Rebuild,
for example) are incorrectly formatted in places.
