This is the main trunk of the DOS ph client distribution tree.  There
are clients for four TCP/IP protocol stacks: Beame and Whiteside;
PC/TCP by FTP Software; PCNFS by Sun; and a packet driver client that
uses the Waterloo TCP/IP protocol stack.  (The packet driver client may
be used with Novell networks.)

Look in the following subdirectories for more information:

	bw		the Beame and Whiteside client

	pcnfs		the PCNFS client

	packet		a packet driver client

	pctcp		the PC/TCP client

	src		Borland C++ 3.1 sources

	wattcp       	the Waterloo TCP/IP stack support files for
			the packet driver client

For a formatted copy of the Unix ph manual page, look in

	ph.man

Some documentation on the DOS ph client may be found in:

	pcph.doc
