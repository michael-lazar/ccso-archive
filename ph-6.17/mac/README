README for Ph 1.1.1
===================

This is version 1.1.1 of my Mac Ph client. It is for use with the 
UIUC CSO nameserver.

This is a full client which supports queries, record editing, proxy
editing, hero editing, and help.

Ph is a free program. Use it in good health.

The files are:

ph-1.1.1.sea.hqx

   The program. A BinHex'd self-extracting Compact Pro archive.

doc.sea.hqx

   The Mac version of our NU Ph document, "Ph - An Electronic
   Campus Directory System," in Microsoft word format, as a BinHex'd 
   self-extracting Compact Pro archive.

source-1.1.1.sea.hqx

   Source code. A BinHex'd self-extracting Compact Pro archive.
   The source is in MPW 3.2 C.
   
mod_history

   A history of mods to the Mac Ph client.

If you are a Ph administrator interested in supporting the use of
the Mac client at your site, you will also want to get some of the
files in the directory pub/ph/admin. See the README file in that
directory for details.
