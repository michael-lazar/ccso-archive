Subject: Re: CMS client for PH

WHO is a simple PH client which allows queries to be made to a
CSO server CMS. No other functions such as login, edit, etc.
are supported. This code is ugly in bits - if anyone feels like
tidying it up, feel free :)

Software requirements:
======================

TCP/IP for VM Version 1.2 or later
IBM C/370 Compiler and Runtime library (Version 1.2.0)

Creating the module:
====================

You should have 3 files:

   1) WHO   C      - the program itself
   2) WHO   EXEC   - a front-end EXEC which calls WHO C
   3) XLATE H      - Translate table
   4) WHO   README - This file

Change the #define DIRECTORY line in the source to point to the
server you use. You can easily change this to pass the server as
an argument from the front-end exec.

Make sure you have the C/370 disks accessed. You should check the
front-end EXEC and change the code which checks for the availability
of the TCP/IP public code as well as the C/370 library. You should
modify this segment of code to conform to your local sites needs.

CC WHO
LOAD WHO
GEN WHO

Pretty complex, eh? :-)

To run:
=======

WHO <name1> [<name2>]

Where <name1> is the first or last name of the person, and <name2>
lets you optionally refine the search further.

Examples:

         1) WHO Fred
                Will retrieve all people with 'fred' as their first
                or last name

         2) WHO JO*
                Will retrieve all people whose first or last names
                begin with 'JO'   e.g. John Smith or Bill Jones

         3) WHO SM* B*
                Retrieves all those whose first or last names begin

                with SM and the other name starts with a B
                e.g. Bill Smith or Smiley BLOGGS

Disclaimers: This code is totally free. Use it in any way you want,
             but don't hold me or the University liable in any way:)

             If you want to hack/modify it for the better, I'd
             appreciate a copy of the changes. Thanx!
