     _P_h_q_u_e_r_y relies on the _q_i(8) people name server to resolve
     fuzzy addresses, e.g., those sent to _j_p-_m_o_r_g_a_n@_u_i_u_c._e_d_u,
     _J_o_h_n-_M_o_r_g_a_n@_u_i_u_c._e_d_u, or _k_a_9_w_g_n@_u_i_u_c._e_d_u.  The local portion
     of the address (left of the "@") may be either a _p_h(1) alias
     (jp-morgan), name (John-Morgan), or amateur radio callsign
     (ka9wgn) field.

     N.B., _p_h only guarantees the uniqueness of the alias field.
     Should there be two or more John-Morgan s in the ph data-
     base, _p_h_q_u_e_r_y will return an error message suggesting alter-
     natives.  Also note that while ph names have blanks, sending
     a blank embedded in a mail address, no matter what quoting
     is done, is likely to be zapped by some intervening mail
     system.  Therefore blanks in full name addresses should be
     replaced with dashes ("-").  Thus "John Morgan" becomes
     John-Morgan.

     _P_h_q_u_e_r_y is not meant to be invoked directly by users.
     Instead _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l(8) will invoke it as a non-final mailer for
     addresses that have a remote portion of _u_i_u_c._e_d_u.  See the
     NOTES section below for a quick sendmail.cf hack that will
     enable _p_h_q_u_e_r_y alias resolution to be done locally instead
     on on the machines MX'ed for _u_i_u_c._e_d_u.

     The call sequence runs as follows:

     Sendmail resolves one or more addresses in a message from,
     say _j_o_e@_c_h_i_c_a_g_o._e_d_u to _s_o_m_e_o_n_e@_u_i_u_c._e_d_u.

     Sendmail invokes _p_h_q_u_e_r_y as

         phquery -f joe@chicago.edu someone

     The text of the mail message is read by _p_h_q_u_e_r_y on the stan-
     dard input.  _P_h_q_u_e_r_y consults the network _q_i(8) server to
     locate the email address _d_o_d_a@_u_x_1._c_s_o._u_i_u_c._e_d_u for the alias
     _s_o_m_e_o_n_e.

     The header line "X-PH: V<version>@host.domain" is added to
     the mail message where _h_o_s_t._d_o_m_a_i_n is the host where _p_h_q_u_e_r_y
     did the translation.  Sendmail is then invoked again to
     transport the message to its destination.

          and as the recipient for any error messages.  If not
          specified, _p_h_q_u_e_r_y will use the contents of the From:
          field in the message header block instead.

     A vanilla sendmail site can use the syntax _s_o_m_e-_o_n_e@_u_i_u_c._e_d_u
     provided at least one of the following is true:

     a) the sendmail uses MX records,
     b) it has a mailhost or smarterhost relay that does use MX records,
     c) the rules below have been put into their sendmail.cf file.

     Macro M is defined to be the domain for which mail is to be
     accepted for.  At UIUC, it is simply

     DMuiuc.edu

     To invoke _p_h_q_u_e_r_y locally, add the following rule to ruleset
     0 just prior to selecting the local mailer:

     R$+@$M         $#PH  $@$w $:$1

     And define the PH mailer as follows:

     MPH, P=/usr/local/libdata/mail/phquery,
     F=DFMhnmur,    A=phquery $u

     If the IDA sendmail is used, then the steps are slightly
     more involved.  Assuming again that the domain is uiuc.edu,
     proceed as follows.

     1)   Add phquery support to sendmail.cf:

          cd sendmail/ida/cf

          Add the lines below to the m4 file for your machine

          define(ALTERNATENAMES, uiuc.edu)
          define(MAILERTABLE, LIBDIR/mailertable)

          Build the sendmail.cf file and install it in the standard location.

     2)   Assuming LIBDIR was defined in the Makefile as
          /usr/local/libdata/mail, the next steps are

          cd /usr/local/libdata/mail
          cat > mailertable
          PH!your.host.domain           uiuc.edu
          ^D
          cat > Makefile
          mailertable.dir:    mailertable
               ./dbm -L make mailertable mailertable
          ^D


     Type 'make' and restart the sendmail daemon.

     N.B., the --pp option sends copies of failed mail to Postmas-
     ter.  While usually a discreet person, it would still not be
     wise to discuss sensitive topics via email.  This is useful
     advice at any time.
