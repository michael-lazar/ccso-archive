     _Q_i manages the database of the CCSO Nameserver.  It is the
     "server" program of the server-client pair that make up the
     CCSO Nameserver (the client program is _p_h(1)).

     If given the --ww option, _q_i will run in read-only mode; com-
     mands that would change the database are not allowed.  If
     given the --dd option, _q_i will be run as though invoked by a
     daemon; in this case, _q_i will limit the amount of cpu time
     it will consume.

     _Q_i operates in "super-user" mode when run with its standard
     input is a terminal, file, or pipe.  If its standard input
     is none of the above (implying the connection comes from
     over the network) it runs in anonymous mode, and the opera-
     tions that may be performed are limited.

     _Q_i's availability may be controlled by the file
     /_n_a_m_e_s_e_r_v/_d_b/_p_r_o_d._s_t_a.  If this file exists, and the first
     word in it is "read", then all invocations of _q_i will be in
     read-only mode; no writing of the database will be allowed.
     If the first word of the file is not "read", _q_i will refuse
     to run at all.  In either case, the remainder of
     /_n_a_m_e_s_e_r_v/_d_b/_p_r_o_d._s_t_a will be printed by _q_i as the reason
     the database is unavailable.
