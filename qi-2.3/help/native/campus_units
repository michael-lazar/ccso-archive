PH CAMPUS UNIT INFORMATION

The Nameserver database contains information for every campus unit (i.e.,
departments, colleges, schools, administrative offices, etc.) that
appears in the printed version of the "Student/Staff Directory."  The
"name" field of a campus unit entry contains the official name of the
unit as it is given in the printed directory.  The "phone" and "address"
fields contain the main telephone number and address for the unit.  Any
additional information about the unit that appears in the printed
directory (e.g., the names, phone numbers, and addresses of personnel
within the unit; the names, addresses, and phone numbers of offices,
divisions, special programs, or special facilities within the unit;
etc.) are listed in the "text" field.

EXAMPLE
To do a lookup on a campus unit, set the "type" field specifier to "unit"
followed by the name (or partial name) of the unit.  (Note:  The "type"
field specifier [i.e., "type=unit"] is not required, but its use in the
selection clause of the query will limit the search to those items in
the Nameserver database that are explicitly campus units.  Since the
names of campus units often have words in common with the names of
courses in the university timetable, the "type" field specifier is
especially useful for filtering out unwanted timetable entries that
would otherwise match the query expression.):
