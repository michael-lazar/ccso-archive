SYNTAX: status

SUMMARY
The "status" command prints a message about the current status of the
Nameserver database.  In order to use the "status" command, you must be
in ph's interactive mode. Once inside ph, type "status" from the "ph>"
prompt, and the status message will be displayed.

The ph status message contains information of potential interest to
users, such as changes in policy or procedures, announcements of database
updates, notification of the temporary locking of the Nameserver database
(preventing users from changing their entries), etc.  Ordinarily the
current status message is displayed immediately upon entering ph's
interactive mode.
