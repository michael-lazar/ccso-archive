SYNTAX: make name-of-field="value-of-field"...

SUMMARY
The "make" command allows you to change fields in your own Nameserver
entry.  To use the "make" command, you must first login to the Nameserver
(see help on "login").  Then, to change any field in your entry (or to
add a field that doesn't appear in your entry), simply give the command:

   make name-of-field="value-of-field"

The field(s) named in the "make" command will be given the value(s)
specified.  Note that the "value-of-field" part of the command should
be enclosed in double quotation marks.

If you wish to remove a field from your entry, use the "make" command
and give the field an empty value by typing two consecutive double
quotation marks for "value-of-field" (e.g., make email="").  Ph will
then remove the field from your entry.

A useful command in conjunction with "make" is "me".  When you are logged
in to the Nameserver, the "me" command can be used to view each and
every field in your entry and to verify that the changes you made were
what you expected.

EXAMPLES
In the following example, Paul Pomes changes his "email" field to
paul@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu:

   ph> make email="paul@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu"
   200:1 entry changed.

In the next example, Paul removes his phone number (and, thus, the
"phone" field) from his entry in the Nameserver database:

   ph> make phone=""
   200:1 entry changed.

It is possible to change more than one field at a time with the "make"
command.  In the last example, Paul changes his email address and
deletes his phone field with a single command:

   ph> make email="paul@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu" make phone=""
   200:1 entry changed.
