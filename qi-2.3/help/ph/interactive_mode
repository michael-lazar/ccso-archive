The ph user interface has two modes: "command-line mode" and "interactive
mode".  Command-line mode permits the user to process ph queries from
the operating system prompt or so-called "command-line".  If ph is
given no arguments on the command-line, it enters interactive mode,
where it prompts for, executes, and displays the results of Nameserver
commands.

Interactive mode is commonly used to view and change information in
one's own entry or an entry for which one has proxy as well as to process
queries.  It also provides access to a variety of Nameserver commands
not available in command-line mode. To see a list and brief description
of the interactive mode commands, type "help commands".  Some of these
commands require the user to identify him/herself to ph by use of the
"login" command (see help on "login"); others do not.  Interactive mode
commands may be abbreviated, provided enough characters are given to
distinguish them from other commands.

EXAMPLES
If the "ph" command is issued at the operating system prompt
without any arguments (i.e., a query expression), it takes the
user to interactive mode where s/he is presented with the "ph>"
prompt.  Once at the "ph>" prompt, an interactive mode command can
be issued.  The example below shows how one enters interactive mode:

   ux1 4> ph

   100:Ph passwords may be obtained at CCSO Accounting, 1420 DCL.
   100:Be sure to bring your University Id Card. You may not need
   100:a password if you are using the login in your email field.
   200:Database ready.

   ph> [ph is ready and waiting for you to enter a command]

On some Unix systems, it is also possible to enter interactive mode by
invoking ph on the command-line with the name of one of the ten data
types found in the "type" field of the Nameserver database.  These
include: "areacode", "fall", "food", "person", "phone", "spring",
"summer", "timetable", "unit", and "weather".  If ph is invoked with
one of these alternative names, it sets the default type for all queries
to the type specified.  It also displays the name of the specified type
in the interactive mode prompt (e.g., "weather>", "food>", etc., instead
of "ph>").  In the example below, ph is invoked with the name "person"
and enters interactive mode.  All queries processed during the session
default to type "person":

   ux1 9> person
   $Date: 1992/08/17 13:35:39 $$Revision: 5.7 $
   100:Ph passwords may be obtained at CCSO Accounting, 1420 DCL.
   100:Be sure to bring your University Id Card. You may not need
   100:a password if you are using the login in your email field.
   200:Database ready.

Once having entered interactive mode in this manner, it is possible to
override the default type by specifying a different type in the selection
clause of the query:
