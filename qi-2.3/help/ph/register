SYNTAX: register

SUMMARY
The "register" command registers the account from which you logged in
to ph as the electronic mail address in your ph entry.  For example, if
you logged in to ph from the CCSO mainframe "ux1" and your login ID on
"ux1" was "smythe", the "register" command would put the following
information into your "email" field:  "smythe@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu".

To use "register", you must first login to the Nameserver (see help on
"login").  Then, simply type "register" at the "ph>" prompt. The account
into which you are currently logged will automatically be entered into
your "email" field.  If a different address was already in your "email"
field, the "register" command will overwrite it with your current account
information.

The "register" command only works with the ph client for Unix systems.
Other clients generally do not recognize or support this command.

A useful command in conjunction with "register" is "me".  When you are
logged in to the Nameserver, the "me" command can be used to view each
and every field in your entry and to verify that the changes you made
were what you intended.
