This directory contains modified routines from Alec Moffett's CrackLib
library.  Instead of using the user's GCOS field to test for passwords,
these routines use other fields within a user's ph entry.  Note that the
dictionary and other utilities are not included here.  You'll need to get
the vanilla package for that.
