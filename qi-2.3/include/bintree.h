/*
 * Bintree maintains (along with maket) a four-tiered structure consisting
 * of a header, nodes, leaves, and items.
 *
 * ITEMS contain the entries from the hash table (.idx); the string and
 * the hash index are kept in each ITEM.
 *
 * LEAVES contain one or more items, in sorted order, and are linked
 * together.  All the keys in the hash table may be examined in sorted
 * order by traversing the leaves in order and the items in order within
 * the leaves.
 *
 * NODES contain the first four characters of a key, and left and right
 * pointers.  These pointers point to other nodes when positive, or leaves
 * when negative.
 *
 * The QHEADER has some statistics, as well as pointers to the head node
 * and first and last leaves.
 *
 * All pointers are stored as indices, and must be multiplied by the
 * appropriate size to get disk addresses.
 *
 * Leaves (and hence items) and the header are kept in the .seq file.
 * Nodes are kept in the .bdx file.
